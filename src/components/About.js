        Convert Case is designed to be a free to use online text manipulator
        that you can use for efficiency and productivity gains (and in some
        cases just a bit of fun as well). Whether you have mistakenly written
        all your text in capital or you want to quickly align the correct
        capitalisation structure for titles. Convert Case allows you to quickly
        fix any errors as well as produce an array of outcomes from the tools
        above. There are also a range of converters to explore as well such as
        the binary code and morse code translators that will allow you to write
        up standard text and have it translated into the necessary code. You can
        also use the text manipulators to allow your text to stand out. Whether
        thatâ€™s for social media purposes or you want to bring some attention to
        an advertisement, these tools are a great solution for fixing those
        issues too.
